    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
	<h3>The first and only student run multi-disciplinary lab of SRM University. The lab has a funding of $5K+ from the University and has currently 100+ members and associates with it. Students from 8 departments work in 5 research groups concentrating on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, IoT, Computational Biology, Electrical Systems and Mixed Reality(AR/VR).  <br>The lab follows no hierarchical structure and fosters student ideas and interests. Next Tech Lab has advisors from around the world from distinguished affiliates and alumni of institutions like MIT, University of Pittsburgh etc. The lab is currently working on 21 different projects. <br><br><br></h3>

	<h1 style="color: white;">Our Story </h1>
	<h3 style="color:white;padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;text-align: justify;" >Imagine a place where people work on building futuristic prototypes using bleeding edge technology and quickly moving on to cooler tech, avoiding time-sinks to focus on innovative ideas. In the last few weeks, members of the Next Tech Lab have worked on projects spanning Deep Learning (Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence), Mixed Reality (Augmented / Virtual Reality) and Internet of Things. Founded by Anshuman Pandey and Aditthya Ramakrishnan in 2016, The concept came to them while they were on a semester abroad at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on scholarship awarded by SRM University and the US Consulate General Chennai. While working at the MIT Media lab, they were intrigued by the unique anti-disciplinary research culture that peeks years into the future. While the Next Tech Lab doesn’t just ape the Media Lab framework like in Richard Feynman’s anecdotes about “Cargo-Cult Science”, its policies are built to foster innovation. Some of the projects include SRM VR, (available on the Google Play Store), FREA-K (electromagnetic lock using face detection),  multiple prototypes for augmented and virtual reality using technologies like Kinect, Leap motion, Cardboard, Vuforia etc. 

A team from the lab recently won the first ever national AR/VR hackathon in the country, organized by ITC Infotech. The team (Aditthya,Anshuman,Rohan and Raghav) built a mixed reality shopping app with a deep learning recommendation engine within 30 hours, beating out professionals from big companies and established startups to clinch the championship.

With advisors from MIT, the lab often has video conferences on the latest technology. The lab located in UB-706 at SRM University is fully automated with their own lock (FREA-K) along with biometric sensors. They are also in the process of assembling a state-of-the-art rig to train their deep neural nets and render complex graphics for their AR/VR projects. The lab members have also demonstrated their projects to world renowned professors. Recently, Prof. Rohan Abeyaratne from MIT. The professor was incredibly impressed with the lab's output and commended the founders of the lab on bringing back the culture of MIT to their home university. He even stated that the enthusiasm and the level of work being done reminded him of his institution.

The lab is directly managed by the Director E&T of SRM University and is completely student run.</h3>
